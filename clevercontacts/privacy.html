    <h1>Privacy Policy for Clever Contacts</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us at SoftwareByEugene LLC. Clever Contacts does not collect any personal data from you. All processing, including natural language parsing and contact updates, happens locally on your device, ensuring your data stays private.</p>
    
    <h2>What Personal Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Clever Contacts does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All processing is done locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Gmail Privacy</h2>
    <p>If you choose to automatically populate relationship information from Gmail, Clever Contacts requests access to the header metadata of emails in the Gmail account you specify. Specifically, Clever Contacts extracts email addresses from the "To" and "CC" fields in email headers. This access is solely for the app's functionality and is not used for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>Clever Contacts never requests access to or reads the content of your Gmail messages. Furthermore, Google Workspace APIs are not used to develop, improve, or train AI or machine learning models.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Clever Contacts may request permissions to access certain data or device features, such as Contacts, Notifications, or Gmail. These permissions are necessary for core functionality and are not used for any other purpose.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All processing in Clever Contacts, including natural language parsing and contact updates, happens locally on your device. Your data is never sent to external servers. Additionally, any permissions granted (e.g., Gmail) are handled securely and used only for their intended purposes.</p>
    
    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or applicable laws. If we make significant changes, we’ll notify you directly in the app or via email.</p>
